       There are a lot of reasons why one should learn Java
          1)	According to Oracle, over 3 billion devices run Java
          2)	You can develop mobile app with java and with the growing demand mobile one can be sur that the future of the language is safe
          3)	Java has syntax and features that resemble other programming languages like C and C++. Hence leaning java becomes very easy if you have any prior programming        experience in these languages
          4)	Java is a multi-platform language hence no adjustment needed.

        
## Getting Ready for Java
      
   #### Setting Up the Development Environment
        # local 
             # requirment 
                 jdk and IDE OR Editor of choice(eclipse, vscode , netbeans ...)
                 for this project we will use eclipse and vscode

                #Eclipse
                
                
         # Online platform 
                 there are sevral online compilers that support java but in this project we will only introduce jdoodle
                    
              
### getting started with java
      # creating a new project
      # creating your first java app (Hello world)
      # running your app
      
           create a folder HelloWorld 
                  In this folder create a HelloWorld.java file
                  Add the following code
                      / **
                     * Robot
                     * /
                     import java.util. *;
                     public class Robot {
                             public static void main (String [] args) {
                                    System.out.println ("Hello World");

                      }
                  To compile you code, open the explorer menu -> project java -> run
                  -> Hello World
